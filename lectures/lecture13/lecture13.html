				<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p class = "fragment"> Consider the salary of a teacher at a school now and in 1950</p>
					<p class = "fragment"> <font color = "#1b91ff">Is it fair to compare their salaries?</font></p>
					<p class = "fragment"> There salaries will most certainly not be the same </p>
					<p class = "fragment"> The krona has changed a lot, right? </p>
					<p class = "fragment"> <font color = "#1b91ff">How can we most fairly compare these salaries?</font></p>
					<p class = "fragment"> One possibility would be to compare the salaries against a set up comparable goods (e.g. price of milk, liter of gas, price of a stamp, etc)</p>

					<h2>How should we compare test scores on different forms of a test?</h2>

				<h2>Equating in testing</h2>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">We often have multiple forms of a test</li>
						<ul class = "fragment">
						<li> Parallel or alternate form</li>

					<li class="fragment"><strong>Problem:</strong> These tests are composed of different questions with differences in item difficulties</li>
					<li class = "fragment"> <font color = "#1b91ff">Why is this a problem?</font></li>

				<section>
				<h2>Scaled Scores</h2>
				<p class="fragment">Tests need to be comparable across forms</p>
				<p class="fragment">We need to <font color = "#ff2c2d">scale</font> our scores to adjust for different difficulty</p>
				<p class="fragment">For each possible raw score, we will come up with a <font color = "#ff2c2d">scaled score</font> based on the difficulty of the questions</p>
				<p class="fragment"><strong>Review:</strong> What measurement framework do you think we are using?</p>
				</section>

				<!-- <section>
				<h3>Relationship with IRT</h3>
				<p class="fragment">IRT creates scores that are independent of the test and the other test takers</p>
				<p class="fragment">Creating comparable scores isn't really an issue </p>
				<p class="fragment">But we make much, much stronger assumptions</p>

					<h3>Scale Decisions in equating</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Choosing the <font color = "#1b91ff">range</font> of scale scores </li>	
							<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Don't want scale to look like total or percent correct</li>
						</ul>
						<li class="fragment">How fine should our scale be?</li>
							<ul class="fragment">
								<li>Usually, want each raw score to correspond to a unique scaled score</li>
								<li>Need to be careful to not exaggerate precision</li>
							</ul>
						<li class="fragment">Often truncate the scaled scores at the end</li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Allows test takers on an easier form than the reference form to get the highest possible scaled score</li>
								<li class="fragment">Truncate at lower end to avoid meaningless distinctions if scores are below chance alone</li>

				<section>
					<h3>How to create the raw-to-scale conversion</h3>
						<p class = "fragment">Decide on the mean and standard deviation of a group of test takers</p>
						<p class = "fragment">Choose two raw scores, specify their scaled scores, then linearly interpolate the other scores</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h3>General limitations of equating</h3>
						<p class = "fragment">A test taker may know more answers on one form of a test</p>
						<p class  = "fragment"><strong>Equating is unable to adjust scores correctly for every test taker!</strong></p>
						<p class = "fragment">We strive to be approximately correct for our target population</p>
						<p class = "fragment">Two groups could differ based on emphasized material (e.g. a teacher effect)</p>
						<p class = "fragment">Equating results in discrete scores (well, we report them that way)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Symmetry of Equating</h3>
					<p class = "fragment"> A score of 20 on test form A corresponds to a score of 25 on test form B</p>
					<p class = "fragment"> A score of 25 on test form B corresponds to a score of 20 on test form A</p>
					<p class = "fragment">This is known as <font color = "#ff2c2d">symmetry</font></p>
					<p class = "fragment">Statistical prediction isn't like this!</p>

				<section>
				<h3>Cars again</h3>
										<pre><code>
mod1 <- lm(speed ~ dist, cars)
mod2 <- lm(dist ~ speed, cars)

       1 
24.84066 
predict(mod2, newdata = list(speed = 24.84066))
       1 
80.10453

					<section>
					<h3>Equating Designs</h3>
					<ul style="font-size:32px">
						<li class = "fragment">To make scores comparable you need something similar across the forms</li>
						<li class = "fragment">This could involve ... </li>
							<ul>
								<li class = "fragment">Same group</li>

										<li class="fragment">Differences in score distributions are a function of form difficulty</li>
									</ul>
								<li class = "fragment">Equivalent groups</li>

				<h3>Our first def'n of Equating</h3>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;A score on the new form and a score on the reference form are equivalent in a group of test takers if they represent the same relative position in the group.&rdquo;</blockquote>
				<!-- <p class = "fragment">An equating method is used to specify this relationship</p> -->
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Mean Equating</h3>
					<p class = "fragment">The simplest form of equating involves adjusting the scores by the difference in means between the reference and new forms</p>
					<p class = "fragment">Substraction of values if the new form is easier</p>
					<p class = "fragment">Addition of values if the new form is harder</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<p >Suppose the target population's mean on the reference form was 80 and their mean on the new form was 85.</p>
					<ol class = "fragment">
						<li>Which form was harder?</li>
						<li>What should should someone with a 90 on the new form get on the reference form if we were using mean equating?</li> 
					</ol>

					<h4>Problem with mean equating (Livingston, 2014)</h4>
					<img src = "images/mean_problem.png" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Linear equating</h3>
					<p class = "fragment">We need to adjust based on how high or low a test taker's score is from the mean</p>
					<p class = "fragment"><font color = "#1b91ff">What might we consider doing?</font></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Equating better def'n</h3>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;
A score on the new form and a score on the reference form are equivalent in a group of test takers if they are the same number of standard deviations above or below the mean of the group.
 &rdquo;</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
				<p><strong>Linear equating a harder new form (Livingston, 2014)</strong></p>
					<img src = "images/linear_equating.png" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Linear equating conceptually</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>Make the adjusted new form mean equal to the reference score mean</li>
					<li>Same with standard deviations above and below the mean</li>
					<li>Do this for every possible value</li>
					<li>This results in a linear relationship between the new form raw and the new form adjusted scores</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Doing the maths!</h3>
					<p>Let <em>NF</em> stand for a score on the new form and <em>RF</em> a score on the reference form</p>

					$$
					\frac{RF - \bar{RF}}{sd(RF)} = \frac{NF - \bar{NF}}{sd(NF)}
					$$
					<p class="fragment current-visible">What do these formulas look like?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Our new adjusted score</h3>
					$$
					RF = \frac{sd(RF)}{sd(NF)}NF + \bar{RF} - \frac{sd(RF)}{sd(NF)}\bar{NF} = \text{adjusted } NF
					$$

					<p class = "fragment">Note, the adjusted <em>NF</em> score is very unlikely to ever be a whole number</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<table>
					<tr><td>Form</td><td>Mean</td><td>Standard Deviation</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Reference</td><td>82</td><td>15</td></tr>
					<tr><td>New</td><td>79</td><td>14</td></tr>
					</table>
					<p>If someone scored an 80 on the new form, what should there reference form score be?</p>

				</section>


				<section>
							$$RF = \frac{15}{14}80 + 82 - \frac{15}{14}79$$

										<pre class="fragment"><code>
# Do the math in R and save it as RF
RF <- (15 / 14) * 80 + 82 - (15 / 14) * 79

# Print RF
RF
[1] 83.07143
 					</code></pre>

 					<p class = "fragment"><font color = "#1b91ff">Does 83.07413 seem sensible?</font></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Problems with linear equating</h3>

					<p class = "fragment">A very high or very low score can equate to a score outside of the range on the reference form</p>
					<p class = "fragment">Depends heavily on the group of test takers (e.g. are they strong test takers? weak test takers?)</p>
					<img class = "fragment" src = "images/linear_equate_prob.png" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Equipercentile equating</h3>
					<blockquote>
						&ldquo;To equate scores on the new form to scores on the reference form in
a group of test takers, transform each score on the new form to the score on the reference form that has the same percentile rank in that group.&rdquo;
					</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h4>Equipercentile equating with a harder new form</h4>
					<img src = "images/equipercentile.png" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Equipercentile equating</h3>
					<p class="fragment">15th percentile of the adjusted test form corresponds (as much as possible) to 15th percentile on the reference form and so on</p>
					<p class="fragment">Adjusted scores will all fall within the range of possible scores on the reference form</p>
					<p class="fragment">The steepness of the slope of the curve can vary </p>
					<p class="fragment">Will result in the adjusted test scores having a similar distribution to the reference form</p>
					<p class="fragment"><font color = "#1b91ff">Will be identical to linear equating when the distribution of scores on the new form has the same shape as the distribution of the scores on the reference form</font></p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Smoothing</h3>
					<img src = "images/smoothing.png"/>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Limitations of equipercentile</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Equating relationship is bound by the highest and lowest observed score</p>
					<p class="fragment">On a difficult test, the highest possible raw score might not be observed</p>
					<p class="fragment">Future administration could result in a higher score being observed</p>
					<p class="fragment">Smoothing may help with this</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Again, the discreteness problem (Livingston, 2014)</h4>
					<img src="images/equi_discrete.png"/>
					<p class="fragment">Can use interpolation to calculate unobserved raw score</p>
				</section>

			

				<section>
					<h3>Concluding remarks on equating</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class = "fragment">Lots of other equating methods exist beyond these three</li>
						<li class = "fragment">Lots of other equating design exist beyond these introduced (briefly)</li>
						<li class = "fragment">Non-equivalent group designs are tricky</li>
						<li class = "fragment">The equate package in R does all of this (and more)</li>
